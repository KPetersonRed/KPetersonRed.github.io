Over a decade ago I worked as a programmer, a profession I sort of stumbled into simply because my work cubicle was right by the software engineer team.  I've always had an innate interest in coding, making it work, how and why.  Making the code work is one of the neverending challenges which come with programming; a challenge I love. Simply put, coding was never something I had considered doing until I saw it every day at work.  Once I saw it I was hooked.   I tend to view programming and as absolute in nature.  All code is based on the same primary rules; rules which are pretty black and white. Those are both aspects that are a draw as well.  

I'll write more later...being a part of the [Flatiron Web Developer Program](https://flatironschool.com/) has pushed my limit the last 3 days.  After more hours than I care to admit I finally completed the Tic Tac Toe Game Status lab.  PHEW!!!  

Don't ever give up.  :)
